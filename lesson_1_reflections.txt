How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

It showed what had been added and what had been deleted so I could better pinpoint what might have gone wrong from one version to another.


How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

It could help you eliminate bugs faster.


What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Pro- you have more meaningful commits and its easier to see when something might have gone wrong. Con- human error can affect us and something might not be saved or explained.


Why do you think some version control systems like Git allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others like Google Docs treath each file separately?

Each has its own pros and cons.


How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

Use git log to open up previously saved files and use git diff to check changes between two different files.


How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

It makes me more confident because I can always go back and see what it is that broke and fix it.


Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

Coding?
