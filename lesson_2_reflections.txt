What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repository, git creates a file in your directory. Its necessary in order to start adding commits to track your changes.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area gives us a way to group files together that we want to change when other pieces change rather than change everything or nothing at all. This helps to keep things more organized.
